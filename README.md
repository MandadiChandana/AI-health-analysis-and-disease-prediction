# AI Health Analysis

The "AI Health Analysis" repository is dedicated to analyzing various diseases using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and integrating the results into an Android application.

## Overview

This project utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically CNN, to analyze different diseases based on medical images. The trained models are then integrated into an Android application to provide users with quick and accurate disease diagnosis.


## Features

- **Disease Analysis:** Utilizes CNN models to analyze medical images and detect various diseases.
- **Android Integration:** Integrates the trained models into an Android application for user-friendly disease diagnosis.
- **Dataset Management:** Provides datasets for training and testing the CNN models.

## Contributions

Contributions to AI Health Analysis are welcome! Whether you want to improve the CNN models, enhance the Android application, or add new features, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
